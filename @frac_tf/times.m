%.*  Array multiply.
%   X.*Y denotes element-by-element multiplication. X and Y must have
%   compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same size or
%   one can be a scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for every
%   dimension, the dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same or one
%   of them is 1.
%
%   C = TIMES(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A .* B' when A or B is an
%   object.
%
%   See also MTIMES.
